In this study, we investigate the impact of FHB epidemics in Pennsylvania (PA), and performed *in vitro* and *in vivo* experiments to investigate the differential aggressiveness of *Fusarium graminearum* isolates from all three small-grain producing regions in PA (South, Central, North). For this, a 2-years survey was conducted in PA during Summer 2018 and 2019, where naturally FHB-infected spikes of different small-grain crops were collected (wheat, spelt, rye, and barley). FHB severity (%) information was recorded from each field. In the laboratory, a molecular-based approach was used to investigate the potential for mycotoxin production potential from the *F. graminearum* isolates obtained in 2018. This new knowledge will help us better understand the influence of specific management strategies in each region on the occurence of FHB epidemics and mycotoxin development.
